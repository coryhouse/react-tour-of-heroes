#React Hero

This is an implementation of Angular 2's Tour of Hero's tutorial application, but built in React for comparison. This project uses [React Slingshot](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot) as a quick framework for getting started, so check out [React Slingshot's docs](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot) for a full overview of the React stack involved.

For comparison, check out the [Angular 2 version]().

##Get Started
1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`
